GARD (Google AdSense for Responsive Design) allows you to easily place Responsive Google AdSense in your WordPress website's content.

== Description ==

GARD allows you to easily place responsive (asynchronous optional) Google AdSense in your website's content via the use of the shortcode [GARD]. GARD offers extreme control over ad placement and features. With a super simple "BASIC MODE", all you need to do is drop in your AdSense publisher ID, check a few boxes, and you're all set with a fully responsive AdSense campaign.

GARD allows custom CSS styling, so you can customize the look of ads anytime you'd like.

The inserted ads will never exceed the content area width, and will select the largest available size ad to show depending on which ads you have provided GARD to pick from.

1. Profit??? (Literally, it's AdSense, so.... Profit!)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need my own AdSense account to make this work? =

Yes.

= Will this work on my Multi User (MU) installation? =

This has not been tested in a MU environment. We have reports of it crashing MU websites, so I would only test on a non live website.

= Can I make my ads align left or right? =

Yes. If you would like your ads to align left, use the shortcode [GARD align="left"]. The same is true for center and right.  
Samples:  
[GARD] will not center or wrap text.  
[GARD align="left"] will make your ad align left and text wrap around it.  
[GARD align="center"] will make your ad centered and text wrap NOT around it.  
[GARD align="right"] will make your ad align right and text wrap around it.  

= Do I have to create ads for every size? =

No. You will only need to create an ad for each size that you want displayed. Feel free to leave the field(s) blank to skip that size.

= How do you prevent GARD from displaying more than 3 ads on one page? =

We check for three types of ads; link units, ad units, and the 300x600 ad size. If either the link units, or ad units already have 3 per page, we don't output ads. Same goes for the 300x600, if there is already one on the page, we don't output a 2nd.

= What are the different versions of the plugin? =

GARD (What you're looking at now)  
[GARD Pro](http://thepluginfactory.co/warehouse/gard-pro "GARD Pro") (Offers many additional features to extend GARD)  
* GARD Pro costs $24.95, and is appropriate if you expect to make more than $24.95 in ad revenue from your site. :P

= How do I contact the plugin developer for help? =
Support is available on [GARD Official WordPress Plugin Support Forum](http://thepluginfactory.co/community/forum/plugin-specific/gard-google-adsense-for-responsive-design/ "GARD Official WordPress Plugin Support Forum").
